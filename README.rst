===============

an early version of a node editor written in Qt and C++11. may still contain
lot's of bugs, and some logical issues. upcomming changes will contain (but will
not be limited to):

* Qt naming scheme of methods, variables, etc.
* develop data model
* moving some of the UI logic to the data model (node.hpp and node.cpp)

Example:
