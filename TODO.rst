TODO
====

* move visualization of items to graphicsnodeview, and graphicsnodescene only to
  handle all the items
* change all occurences of QPoint to QPointF: QGraphicsScene works on a real
  based coordinate system
* coherency in enum-, function-, variable-, class-naming
* change BezierEdge such that it decides the internal anchor nodes for the curve
  depending on if the edge-endpoint is linked to a sink or a source
